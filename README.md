**A multi-purpose tweaking tool to remove Amazon Alexa from your device for good.**
</div>



# ❓ Why?
**No one likes Amazon Alexa.** Many people in the Amazon ecosystem are against Alexa because of the constant intrusive nature of it. In newer updates Alexa got more invasive and was embedded into Kindles so deeply to the point there was no guaranteed way to disable it or turn it off anymore. There have been many studies and articles that prove Alexa listens in to your conversations, enables at random, and sends unconsentual and unwanted data to Amazon. They purposefully make it very hard to turn off these settings and to turn off certain tracking analytics.
